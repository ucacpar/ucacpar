Hi, Iâ€™m @ucacpar
I enjoy writing programs. I could probably find what I need somewhere else but I like to write my own.
Currently I use python, but have used many, many others including 'snobol': many years ago. 
At one stage (circa 1977) I knew the 8080 machine code by heart as I had to write code for an 8080 pcb I'd built 
to fly on a high-altitude ballon and we didn't have access to anything that had any software tools, so I wrote what I needed.
